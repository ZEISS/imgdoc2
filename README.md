## What

imgdoc2 is an **experimental** data-management component for multi-dimensional and tiled 2D- and 3D-images (as e.g. used in microscopy).

It is in a very early stage.

## Why

Goal is to research and evaluate the feasibility of leveraging an RDBMS (and SQLite in particular) for managing and persisting multi-dimensional documents as used in microscopy.
