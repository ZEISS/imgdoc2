***imgdoc2API - flat API for imgdoc2***

This is the documentation of the flat API for imgdoc2. The purpose and goal is to provide an interface layer which can easily be consumed when
bindings for other languages (other than C++) are needed. The API is designed to be as simple as possible and to be as close as possible to the original.
